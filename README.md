# website
I'm working on my website where I'll keep info about my projects, a portfolio and resume and maybe a blog in the future. Right now it's very basic and it is going to completely change later. I'm not a fan of the colors right now, I'll change them later. Ignore the shoshinsha mark icon (it was by Joypixels from creazilla [link](https://creazilla.com/media/emoji/48446/japanese-symbol-for-beginner)), I just put it there temporarily until I make my own. The font isn't set yet and styles are very minimal. The links all lead back to index.html since I haven't created the other pages. The social links just go to the normal websites, not any special profile. Special info such as projects, images, descriptions, blogs posts, links, and more will be added with js to keep the html and css clean, reusable, and modular. The code is not the best and could be better. If you want to help clean it up, feel free to make a pull request or report an issue.

The website has not been deployed and is not hosted anywhere currently, only avaible locally. I will most likely set up github pages and then move on from there.
